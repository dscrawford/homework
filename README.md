# Class Descriptions
*\* - interesting projects*

*CS 1136 - Programming Fundamentals Lab*

Basic C++ programming, beginner programs.

*CS 1336 - Programming Fundamentals Lecture*

Like CS 1336, but projects slightly bigger.

*CS 1337 - Computer Science I*

C++ programming with introduction to pointers and data structures.

*CS 2336 - Computer Science II*

Learning everything that was being done with C++ but instead now doing it with Java.

*CS 3345 - Data Structures & Algorithms*

Programs made in Java, mostly implementations of popular data structures from scratch.

\**CS 3377 - C/C++ Programming in a UNIX Environment*

Learned how to make C++ programs from scratch inside emacs/vim, projects include making a compiler (Program 4)
and making a file health program (Program 5). Starting from project 3, all programs can be compiled using `make`

*CS 3354 - Software Engineering*

Class looked into the business approaches to software instead of programming. (Boring stuff lol)

*CS 4337 - Organization of Programming Languages*

Involved using different programming paradigms to write certain functions. Programs are not too interesting here.

\**CS 4348 - Operating Systems Concepts*

These programs reflect a concept in operating systems and try to either simulate or utilize these concepts.

*CS 4384 - Automata Theory*

Not programs, just homeworks on theory thingys like DFAs and NFAs

*ECS 3390 - Professional and Technical Communication*

Sortof a busy work class not worth your time

\**CS 4341 - Digital Logic and Computer Design*

Involved using verilog for simulating circuits. Projects are interesting but probably not too relevant.

*CS 4347 - Database Systems*

Not so much implementation in here, more about descriptions about concepts in database design

\**CS 4361 - Computer Graphics*

Graphics projects designed using Java awt. These are neat projects because they are actually visualizing things.
Some of y most fun projects are in here.
