In lab 3 exercise 1, the computer is asking for an input of a:
character, then an integer, then a character, then a string, then a float
Whenever the values x1234yjohn 10.5 are input, the computer reads the first character then see's
the integer and has an error. Because of this, the computer just runs to the next line and then the
integers are recorded until the character comes up. So basically, the computer is doing this because
it is running the next line after it doesn't understand the input value, so in turn the computer goes
to the next line and continues the program. Although, when 189j110.5 is input into the command line,
the computer has considered the values 110.5 to be a string. This can be explained because when the computer
asks for a string, it is a completely unformated number that can not be used in calculations but could be
printed out in the command line. For example, while a computer would change a number like int 2.10 to just 2,
when it is a string the computer will print out the precise value inside of it, ex: string "3.14159". So the computer
has registered the last number as a string, so the program is waiting for a float number to be input afterwards.
