Linear Search
	Also called the sequential search
	
Binary Search
	Requires array elements to be in order
	
	1. Divides the array into three sections:
		Middle elements
		Elements on one of of middle elements
		Elements on other side of middle
		
	2.	If the middle element in the correct value, its done
		Otherwise, go to step 1 using only half of the array that could contain the correct value
	
	3. Continue steps 1. and 2. until either the value is found and there are no more elements to examine.
	Benefits:
		More efficient than a linear search
		For array of N elements, performs at most log_2(N) comparisons
	Disavanttages:
		Requires that array elements be sorted
