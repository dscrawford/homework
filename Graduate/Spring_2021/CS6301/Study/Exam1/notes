# R Questions #
the NULL is called NA
1-D -> vector
2-D -> matrix, dataframe (friendlier API)
list -> can have any number of elements of any type

list elements can be accesses by double square brackets
list$elementName

how to loop through elements
 1. Loop (for, while)
 2. Apply family -> more efficient alternatives to traditional loops
      sapply (vector) # returns a vector
      lapply (list) # returns a list
      apply (matrix) # returns a matrix

matrix:
  order(m$column) -> sorted indices

if you want to see the code (C) behind a commend, simply type command name

4. how to write custom (user-defined) functions, and use them in r-family

lapply applies a function to every element of the list
  if the element is a vector, you can apply any vector fu

write a custom function for a list:
  if list element is a vector: give me the mean
  if list element is a matrix: give me the mean of each row

strengths of R:
  1. vectorized data structures and functions
  2. easy plot
    type, legend, col, lwd
