Do while loop endlessly executes as long as the user or program allows it to(as long as expression is true)
Can stop invalid inputs
To stop bad inputs from messing up code:
	if (cin >> dvalue)
	{
	//valid double
	}
	else {
	string dummy;
	cin.clear();
	getline(cin,dummy);
	}
	
getline(cin, strvalue)) purges the value, if you use a dummy string.
cin.clear() gets rid of the error state.
string string gives a key value for analysing the program.

5.6 The for Loop

1) Perform initialization
2) Evaluate test expression
	If true, execute statement or block
	If false, terminate loop expression
Perform the initialization expression
A Pre test loop

Comma operator:
if(x>10, x<100)
evaluates x>10 as true or false,
then sees the comma and erases the true/false
evaluates x>100 as the final value

Keeping a running total
running total: accumulated sum of numbers from each repetition of loop
accumulator: variable that holds running tool

5.11 Using files and Data Storage
	Use files instead of keyboard, monitor screen for program input.
	Use fstream header file for file access
	
	File stream types:
	ifstream: input
	ofstream: output
	fstream: input from or output to a file
	Define file stream objects:
	ifstream infile;
	ofstream outfile;
	
	Opening Files
	Create a link between file name and file stream object
	Output file will be create if necessary; existiing file will be erased first
	Input file must exist for open to work
	
	USEFUL COMMANDS:
	!infile = infile.fail()         --- Didnt open properly
	inFile.eof()                    --- End of file
	
	Can use output file object and << to send data to file
	EX: outfile << "Inventory report";
	
	Using loops to process Files
	
	the stream extraction operator >> returns true when a value was successfully read, false otherwise
	Can be tested in a while loop to continue execution as long as they are read from the file
	
	Close
		Use the close member function:
		infile.close();
		outfile.close();
	
	Letting User Specify a filename
		You can pass a string object as an argument to a file stream objects open member function.
