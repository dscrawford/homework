## REQUIREMENTS

This project is developed for python 2.7
This project uses pandas and sklearn, make sure these are installs. On csgrads1, it seems sklearn is no longer available, unsure how to deal with this without root priviledges.

## SETUP

To setup, just make sure that ML_Homework_2.py is in the same directory as the datasets 'train/', 'test/', 'enron1', 'enron4'

## Running code

python ML_Homework_2.py ['enron1', 'enron4']

Leave arguments empty to just work on train/ and test/

EX: python ML_Homework_2.py
OR
    python ML_Homework_2.py enron1
