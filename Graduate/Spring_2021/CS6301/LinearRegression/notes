Y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + ...

hypothesis is that x1 and x2 are important

house price = b0 + b1 * (Area) + b2 * (no of bedrooms) + b3 * (avg house price)

  hypothesis: (Area), (no of bedrooms), (avg house price)
    -> Ha
    -> H1
    -> positive hypothesis
    
  null hypothesis:
    -> Area is not useful
    -> (no of bedrooms) is not useful
    
  e.g. positive: to predict underground oil, surface humidity is important
       null: surface humidity is not important
       
Task: To prove null hypothesis wrong


t-values: (b_i - 0) / (Se(b_i))
want t-value to be high, or very precise!


GPA = b0 + b1 * (attendance)

Important things:

  1. Coefficient estimate and p-value analysis
      point estimate of b1 -1
      se of b1 -2
      t-statistic by 1/2
      p-value (A high p-value indicates your results are by chance, no correlation)
        if p-value is very small (p < 0.05 or lower) -> you can reject null hypothesis, else you cannot
    
  2. Residuals (error)
    1st point: actual (y1) predicted (y1^) -> abs diff residual 1
    2nd point: actual (y2) predicted (y2^) -> abs diff residual 2
    
    what is residual or ss of residual
  
  3. Anaysis of Variance
    how much variance is being explained by the model
    
  4. Comparison between a model with no variables and my model
      GPA = b0 + b1 (null model)
      GPA according to my model
      
      F-statistic = performance of my model / performance of null model
                  = (variance explained by model) / variance by null mode
                  
      feature selection
          x1, x3, x5        F1
          null model
          
          
          x2, x4, x5        F2
          null model
          
R**2
      -> correlation between model output and true values
      
      
--
if you keep on adding variables (attributes/features), then R**2 will continue increasing by small values.
