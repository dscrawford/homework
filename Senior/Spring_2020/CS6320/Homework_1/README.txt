# Setup

Please have train.txt and test.txt in the same directory as the .cc files.
Then, type 'make' to compile everything.

# Execution

./bigram [train file name] [test file name] [0|1]
EX:
./bigram train.txt test.txt 1

# Formatting

To avoid formatting errors, disable any text wrap and the matrices will be aligned
For example, in emacs type "M-x toggle-truncate-mode" to format the matrices correctly.
